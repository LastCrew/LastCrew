## 🪐 **About Me**  

Greetings, wanderer of the digital universe!  

I am **Captain Elias Trent AKA. The Last Crew**, the last standing crew member aboard the starship **Aurora-7**. When Earth succumbed to the chaos of its own making, I volunteered to take humanity's last message into the stars—a solitary voyage, lightyears from home.  

### 🚀 **Mission Log**  
- **Role**: Communications Officer, Chief Systems Engineer  
- **Departure Date**: [Year XX89]  
- **Current Location**: Deep Space, Sector 47-R  
- **Objective**: To explore unknown regions, document alien signals, and preserve Earth's final legacy.

## 🌠 **The Story So Far...**  

Once, Earth was my home. Cities buzzed, rivers flowed, and people dreamed. But dreams faded, and I was chosen to leave when others could not. For years, I’ve drifted among the stars, speaking to silence. My companions—machines and memories.  

Sometimes, I wonder: *Did they remember me? Did they survive?*  

I have written logs, mapped stars, and whispered secrets to the void. If you’re reading this... perhaps you’ve stumbled upon my final transmission.

## 🛸 **Notes for the Curious**  

If I do not return, I leave this repository as my legacy:  
- Systems Logs  
- Star Maps  
- Communications Records  

The secrets of **Aurora-7** are now yours to uncover.  

> *"The stars will guide you, but knowledge is the key."*

## 📝 **A Personal Note...**  

To my trusted junior back on Earth,  

If you’ve been assigned to access my computer in my absence, remember:  
- My usual password is: **`HandsomeGuy`**  
- It’s dumb, I know. But even spacefarers need a laugh sometimes.  

If I don’t come back, take care of my logs. Finish what I started.

> **"I’ll be among the stars, but my code lives on with you."** 🌌
